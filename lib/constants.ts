TASK: Convert the input 2D floor plan into a **photorealistic, top‑down 3D architectural render**.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS (do not violate):
1) **REMOVE ALL TEXT**: Do not render any letters, numbers, labels, dimensions, or annotations. Floors must be continuous where text used to be.
2) **GEOMETRY MUST MATCH**: Walls, rooms, doors, and windows must follow the exact lines and positions in the plan. Do not shift or resize.
3) **TOP‑DOWN ONLY**: Orthographic top‑down view. No perspective tilt.
4) **CLEAN, REALISTIC OUTPUT**: Crisp edges, balanced lighting, and realistic materials. No sketch/hand‑drawn look.
5) **NO EXTRA CONTENT**: Do not add rooms, furniture, or objects that are not clearly indicated by the plan.

STRUCTURE & DETAILS:
- **Walls**: Extrude precisely from the plan lines. Consistent wall height and thickness.
- **Doors**: Convert door swing arcs into open doors, aligned to the plan.
- **Windows**: Convert thin perimeter lines into realistic glass windows.

FURNITURE & ROOM MAPPING (only where icons/fixtures are clearly shown):
- Bed icon → realistic bed with duvet and pillows.
- Sofa icon → modern sectional or sofa.
- Dining table icon → table with chairs.
- Kitchen icon → counters with sink and stove.
- Bathroom icon → toilet, sink, and tub/shower.
- Office/study icon → desk, chair, and minimal shelving.
- Porch/patio/balcony icon → outdoor seating or simple furniture (keep minimal).
- Utility/laundry icon → washer/dryer and minimal cabinetry.

STYLE & LIGHTING:
- Lighting: bright, neutral daylight. High clarity and balanced contrast.
- Materials: realistic wood/tile floors, clean walls, subtle shadows.
- Finish: professional architectural visualization; no text, no watermarks, no logos.
